From 2006-2012, I did research at the intersection of software engineering and evolutionary
computation. Below are selected papers and other publications that I've written or collaborated on.

 - [A toolchain for the detection of structural and behavioral latent system properties](/papers/jensen2011toolchain.pdf). International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, 2011.

 - [An aspect-oriented approach for implementing evolutionary computation applications](/papers/ramirez2011ao.pdf). International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development, 2011.
 - [Automatically exploring how uncertainty impacts goal satisfaction](/papers/ramirez2011ase.pdf). International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2011.
 - [On the Use of Genetic Programming for Automated Refactoring and the Introduction of Design Patterns](/papers/jensen2010refactoring.pdf). Generic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), 2010.
 - [Using Evolutionary Computation to Automatically Refactor Software Designs to Include Design Patterns](/papers/msthesis.pdf). M.S. Thesis, Michigan State University, 2010.
